# Weather-Dashboard-Challenge-6

## Description

With the goal of having a place to search for current wather conditions and a 5 day forecast for a given city, I created a Weather Dashboard. On loading hte page, you are given a simple search box to enter a city. After clicking submit, you are shown the current and future weather conditions. You will see the city name, date, a weather icon representation of the conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity. That search will populate into a "Previus Search" section containing clickable buttons. At any time, you can clisk a previus seach button and the current condtions as well as the 5 day forecast will populate.  If you refresh the page, your previous search list will persist.
